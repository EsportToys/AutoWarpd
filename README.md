# AutoWarpd
A hacky version of some of [rvaiya/warpd](https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd)'s features, implemented in AutoIt for Windows. 

Decided to make this on a whim after this discussion on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33222215

## Instructions:

### Grid Mode

1. Press `Alt` `Shift` `G` to activate overlay. You'll see your main cursor switched to a crosshair, and a thin grey border surrounding your screen.
2. Press `I`/`J`/`K`/`L` to bisect the warp region and move your cursor to its center.
3. Press `F`/`E`/`R` to left/right/middle click at the cursor position.
4. Press `Esc` to quit mode.

### Inertia Mode

1. Press `Alt` `Shift` `C` to activate inertia mode. You'll see your main cursor switched to a crosshair.
2. Use `I`/`J`/`K`/`L` to move the cursor, hold `Shift` to apply brakes for slower/more precise movement, release `Shift` to reset velocity. Hold `CapsLk` to scroll vertically/horizontally.
3. Press `F`/`E`/`R` to left/right/middle click at the cursor position.
4. Press `Esc` to quit mode.
